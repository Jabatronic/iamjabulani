# IAMJABULANI

> IAMJABULANI started life as my attempt to create a statically generated portfolio/résumé site for myself built on the Nuxt framework. In the end it has grown into my own scaffold for rapid prototyping PWAs. 

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
